	<h1>TEAM HISTORY</h1>
	 <p>In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment
	 of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.In January 2008, the BCCI
	 unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. It was sold to the India 
	 Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai,
	 Bangalore and Hyderabad.India Cements acquired the rights to the franchise for 10 years.</p>
	 <p>During the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008,
	 the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni,
	 Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey. Dhoni became the costliest
	 player of the auction, as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million.The franchise named Dhoni
	 as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.They played their first 
	 game on 19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after
	 posting 240/5 in 20 overs, which was the highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by 
	 themselves in 2010.The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished
	 third on the points table.They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal.The Super Kings
	 faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the Super Kings scored 163/5
	 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.</P>
	 <p>
	 In 2010, the Super Kings struggled in the first half of the regular season, winning only two matches out
	 of seven. They won four of their next five games in the season mainly due to the efforts of Murali Vijay
  and Suresh Raina. After a defeat at home to the Delhi Daredevils, the Super Kings were left with a must-win
  match against Kings XI Punjab at Dharamsala. The Super Kings won the match by six wickets as they chased down
  the target of 193 with two balls to spare with skipper Dhoni scoring an unbeaten 54 from 29 balls.Chennai got
  the third place as they had the better net run rate of the four teams which finished on 14 points.In the semifinal,
  the Super Kings scored a modest 142/7 in 20 overs against the defending champions Deccan Chargers. But an 
  inspired bowling spell from Doug Bollinger (4/13 in four overs) did the most damage as the Chargers were bowled
  out for 104. This gave the Super Kings a 38-run victory that took them to the final. The Super Kings faced the
  tournament favorites Mumbai Indians at their home ground in the final.Suresh Raina's 57 (35) helped the Super
  Kings recover from 68/3 after 12 overs to put up 168/5 at the end of their 20 overs. Then, their spin duo of
  Ravichandran Ashwin and Muralitharan conceded only 41 runs in the 8 overs bowled between them to help the Super 
  Kings won the game by 22 runs and secure their first ever IPL title.With this, the Super Kings also qualified for 
  the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 that was held in South Africa.
